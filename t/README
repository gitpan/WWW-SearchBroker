Self test suite for the SearchBroker modules
--------------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you
run the tests with "make test" at the top WWW::SearchBroker directory.
Use -v option for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test
like this:

  ./TEST -v base/date

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST base
